							<p> My Ph.D. research leverages Nitric Oxide (NO), a gasotransmitter (gaseous messenger molecule), to create composite materials/surfaces and coatings with biomedical applications. NO is a key gas molecule with versatile physiological functions, including vasodilation, modulating blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation, prevention of platelet adhesion, antimicrobial and antiviral action, etc. My research focus throughout my Ph.D. can be broadly classified into two aspects of NO technology - </p>
							<h2>Catalytic nitric oxide producing interfaces from endogenous and synthetic nitrosothiols.</h2>
							<p>Blood contains NO precursors in the form of S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) and nitrites. The decomposition of RSNOs produces thiyl radicals and NO as a product. Catalysts such as metal ions are known to aid in the process and increase NO generation from RSNOs. We investigate if metal nanoparticles within a polymer matrix co-doped with synthetic RSNOs can catalytically increase NO surface fluxes from the polymer. In addition, these polymer-metal composites can also generate NO from endogenous RSNOs, simultaneously. Thus, presenting a single platform solution for NO production from endogenous and synthetic source pools. Biomimetic synthetic metalloenzymes are also synthesized to target the nitrites within the blood, often overlooked as a source for surface NO generation. We translate NO generation technology towards the development of medical device surface designs. Thus, helping reduce the risk of infection or thrombosis that are commonly associated with medical device surfaces.</p>

							<h2>Combination of highly hydrophobic or superhydrophobic anti-fouling biomedical surfaces with
NO</h2>
							<p>Inactivation or prevention of biomolecule adhesion on biomedical surfaces is another research focus area. Modulating NO-releasing surfaces can be rendered highly hydrophobic (HH) or superhydrophobic (SH) and are generally known as non-fouling surfaces. Often, they are inspired by nature, for example, the self-cleaning lotus leaf. Although highly hydrophobic (HH) or superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces can minimize bacterial adhesion, it does not affect the viability of adhered bacteria. With time, the accumulation of bacteria can result in the loss of HH/SH character. In such scenarios, bioactive agents such as NO or metal ions can destroy adhered bacteria.
Polydopamine (PDA) is one of the most versatile polymers used for functionalizing materials, first reported by Professor Messersmith and the team. We have studied the PDA surface chemistry specifically for NO-releasing polymers. In addition, PDA as a bonding agent is also used to immobilize inert polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or antimicrobial peptides such as nisin for a multifunctional/multi-mechanistic outcome. Antimicrobial peptides are a part of the innate immune response produced to inhibit microbial pathogens. Nisin is one such polycyclic cationic peptide that is FDA approved and classified as GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe). Nisin is routinely used in the food industry for coating antimicrobial packaging materials. We explore a clinical aspect of nisin and its immobilization on the surface bulk polymer and nanomaterials.
